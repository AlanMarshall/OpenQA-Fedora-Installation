# OpenQA-Fedora-Installation
Code for the YouTube video 

PART ONE install OpenQA on local VM and get the fist test running. 

## Getting the code

- Since you are already looking at this README I assume you gave some basic knowledge about version control.
- Clone this repo in the Client VM
- Run ```sudo ./install-openqa.sh```
- Go to localhost using the browser and click login
- Run ```sudo ./install-openqa-post.sh``` 
- This takes longer! But after it completes should give out of the box test.
